| **Fiberglass Conversion** | **Permanent solution** | **Varies By Pool** | **25 years** |

### **Gunite & Plaster Structural Repair**

Gunite pools face unique challenges in North Texas. Our expansive soil and weather extremes cause:

* Delamination (plaster separating from gunite)  
* Spalling (surface deterioration)  
* Pop-offs (circular areas of failed plaster)  
* Hollow spots that crack under pressure

**Complete Gunite Restoration Process:**

1. Sound testing to identify all compromised areas  
2. Complete removal of failed material  
3. Structural substrate preparation  
4. Professional bonding agent application  
5. New gunite/shotcrete application (where needed)  
6. Premium plaster finish  
7. Proper curing and startup

**Investment:** $6,000-15,000 depending on pool size and damage extent

### **Bond Beam Repair & Reconstruction**

**The critical repair most companies won't touch**

Your pool's bond beam—the reinforced concrete collar at the top edge—bears tremendous structural loads. When it fails, you need engineering expertise, not handyman repairs.

**Signs of Bond Beam Failure:**

* Tile line cracks (horizontal through tiles)  
* Loose or shifting coping stones  
* Separation between deck and pool  
* Visible gaps at pool edge

**Our Bond Beam Reconstruction:**

* Remove all compromised concrete  
* Install new steel reinforcement with epoxy anchors  
* Form and pour to engineering specifications  
* Restore proper expansion joints (often missing)  
* Waterproof membrane application  
* New tile and coping installation

This complex repair requires expertise most companies lack. We're one of only three contractors in Dallas properly equipped for bond beam reconstruction.

### **Concrete Cancer (Alkali-Silica Reaction)**

**The progressive disease destroying older pools**

Concrete cancer occurs when moisture penetrates concrete, causing rebar to rust and expand. The expansion force—7x stronger than concrete—causes progressive failure that accelerates exponentially.

**Identification:**

* Rust stains bleeding through plaster  
* Concrete spalling (chunks breaking off)  
* Exposed, corroding rebar  
* Map cracking around rust points  
* White calcium deposits (efflorescence)

**Treatment Protocol:**

* **Early Stage** ($2,500-5,000): Remove affected concrete, treat rebar, rebuild  
* **Advanced Stage** ($5,000-12,000): Major reconstruction required  
* **Permanent Cure** ($8,000-15,000): Fiberglass encapsulation stops it forever

*Warning: Delays cost 20% more every 6 months as damage spreads*

## **Why North Texas Pools Need Structural Repair**

### **The Perfect Storm of Damage**

**Expansive Clay Soil** Dallas sits on clay that expands 30% when wet, shrinks dramatically when dry. This creates:

* 4,000 PSI of lateral pressure  
* 2-6 inches of annual movement  
* Differential settling  
* Continuous stress on pool structures

**Extreme Weather Cycles**

* 105°F summers to 15°F winters  
* 90+ freeze-thaw cycles annually  
* Rapid 40°F temperature swings  
* Drought-to-flood extremes

**Construction Deficiencies** (Found in 60% of Pools)

* Insufficient steel reinforcement  
* Gunite thickness below standards  
* Missing expansion joints  
* Poor soil compaction  
* Inadequate concrete coverage over rebar

Without proper repair that addresses these conditions, damage returns quickly.

## **Common Questions**

### **How do I know if my crack is structural?**

**Structural cracks:**

* Run through plaster AND gunite  
* Wider than 1/8 inch  
* Show displacement or offset  
* Have rust stains nearby  
* Continue through tile line  
* Leak water

**Cosmetic cracks:**

* Only in plaster surface  
* Hairline width  
* No water loss  
* No rust staining

When in doubt, get our free professional assessment. Call (972) 789-2983.

### **What about leak detection?**

We partner with certified leak detection specialists when underground leaks are suspected. Once they locate the leak, we handle all repairs. This two-step approach ensures you get the right expertise for each phase.

### **How long do repairs take?**

**Typical timeline:**

* Day 1: Assessment and quote  
* Day 2-3: Preparation and drainage (if needed)  
* Day 3-7: Structural repair work  
* Day 7-10: Curing and finishing  
* Day 10: Pool refill and startup

Most repairs complete within 7-10 days, weather permitting.

### **Will repairs last in Texas soil?**

Yes—when done correctly. We engineer every repair specifically for North Texas conditions:

* Deep-set anchors for soil movement  
* Flexible joint compounds  
* Proper drainage solutions  
* Movement-tolerant materials

Our 25-year warranty on fiberglass conversions proves our confidence.

### **Is this covered by insurance?**

Often, yes. We document:

* Storm and freeze damage  
* Tree root damage  
* "Sudden failure" situations  
* Ground movement (if covered)

We work directly with adjusters and have a 93% approval rate on documented claims.

## **The Cost of Waiting**

### **Every Month of Delay Costs More**

**30 days:** 20% more damage, $500-1,000 additional cost  
 **90 days:** Damage doubles, $2,000-5,000 additional cost  
 **6 months:** Structural compromise, $5,000-10,000 additional cost  
 **1 year:** Often requires complete reconstruction

Plus daily losses:

* Water: 100-500 gallons ($5-25/day)  
* Chemicals: Wasted in leaking water ($3-10/day)  
* Energy: Pumps running longer ($5-15/day)  
* Property damage risk increasing daily

**Bottom line:** Today's $2,000 repair becomes next year's $10,000 reconstruction.
