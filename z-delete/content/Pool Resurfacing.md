## **What Is Pool Resurfacing? Understanding Your Options in Texas**

Pool resurfacing is the process of applying new surface material to a deteriorating pool interior. In North Texas, harsh weather and clay soil movement mean pools require resurfacing every 7-10 years using traditional methods like plaster, marcite, or pebble finishes.

**Traditional pool resurfacing is temporary.** Every replastering costs $8,000-$15,000 and fails again within a decade.

### **The Pool Resurfacing Problem in Dallas-Fort Worth**

North Texas pools face unique challenges:

* **Temperature extremes:** 100°F+ summers, freezing winters cause surface cracking  
* **Clay soil movement:** Creates structural stress requiring frequent repairs  
* **Hard water:** Accelerates surface deterioration and staining  
* **UV exposure:** Breaks down traditional surfaces 30% faster than national average

**Result:** The average Texas homeowner spends **$43,900** on pool resurfacing over 20 years.

### **The Permanent Alternative: Hexagon Fiberglass Pool Resurfacing**

As North & Central Texas' exclusive Fibre Tech™ dealer, Hexagon Fiberglass Pools offers a revolutionary pool resurfacing solution. Instead of applying another temporary surface, we permanently convert your pool to fiberglass with a **25-year warranty backed by both Fibre Tech™ and Hexagon Fiberglass Pools**.

**One Resurfacing. One Warranty. Forever Done.**

## **Why Pool Resurfacing Fails (And How Hexagon Fiberglass Pools Solves It)**

### **Why Traditional Resurfacing Keeps Failing**

#### **1\. Material Porosity**

* Plaster and concrete are naturally porous  
* Water penetrates, causing deterioration  
* Chemicals get absorbed, weakening the structure  
* **Hexagon Solution:** Non-porous fiberglass surface

#### **2\. Rigid Materials Can't Flex**

* Texas clay soil expands/contracts  
* Rigid plaster cracks under movement  
* Cracks grow larger each season  
* **Hexagon Solution:** Flexible material adapts to ground movement

#### **3\. Chemical Degradation**

* Chlorine attacks plaster constantly  
* Salt systems accelerate deterioration  
* pH fluctuations damage the surface  
* **Hexagon Solution:** Chemically inert fiberglass resists all pool chemicals

#### **4\. Temperature Stress**

* 100°F+ surface temperatures  
* Freezing winter conditions  
* Thermal expansion causes cracking  
* **Hexagon Solution:** Engineered for \-40°F to 200°F

#### **5\. Poor Installation**

* Improper mixing ratios  
* Rushed application  
* Inadequate curing time  
* **Hexagon Solution:** Factory-certified installation process

## **Pool Resurfacing FAQ: Your Questions Answered**

### **General Pool Resurfacing Questions**

**Q: How often do pools need resurfacing?** Traditional surfaces need resurfacing every 5-15 years depending on the material. Plaster lasts 5-7 years, pebble 10-15 years in Texas climate. Our fiberglass resurfacing comes with a 25-year warranty and is designed to last decades beyond that.

**Q: How long does pool resurfacing take?** Traditional resurfacing takes 2-3 weeks, including drying time. Our conversion completes in just 5-7 days total, with less mess and no excavation. If there is rain or other inclement weather, this may push the project duration out. If that’s the case, we’ll communicate with you about timeline adjustments.

**Q: Can you resurface a pool without draining it?** No, all pool resurfacing methods require draining. However, our process is faster, allowing you to refill sooner than traditional methods.

**Q: What time of year is best for pool resurfacing?** In North Texas, fall through early spring (October-March) is ideal. Moderate temperatures help materials cure properly. We work year-round, but summer scheduling fills quickly.

### **Cost & Value Questions**

**Q: Is pool resurfacing worth it?** Traditional resurfacing is necessary maintenance that you'll repeat every 7-10 years. Fiberglass resurfacing may cost more initially, but it eliminates future resurfacing, saving $22,500+ over 20 years.

**Q: Does pool resurfacing increase home value?** Yes, a newly resurfaced pool can add $5,000-$10,000 to home value. The 25-year **Transferable** warranty is particularly attractive to buyers as it eliminates a major maintenance concern.

**Q: Can I finance pool resurfacing?** Yes, we offer 12-month 0% financing for qualified buyers. Many homeowners also use home equity lines or pool renovation loans. Ask your sales rep about our financing options.

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: Can you resurface a gunite pool with fiberglass?** Yes, gunite pool conversion is our specialty. Resurfacing permanently solves common gunite problems like cracking, rough texture, and high maintenance requirements.

**Q: What causes pool resurfacing to fail?** In Texas: extreme temperatures, ground movement, chemical damage, and poor installation. Traditional materials can't handle these stresses. Fibre Tech™ is engineered specifically for these challenges.

**Q: Can you resurface a fiberglass pool?** Yes, we can restore existing fiberglass pools with spider cracks, fading, or other damage using our Fibre Tech™ process.

### **Service Questions**

**Q: Do you provide pool maintenance after resurfacing?** No, we specialize in pool resurfacing only. Once we begin filling your pool, you'll need your regular pool service for water chemistry and maintenance. We provide the surface, you maintain the water.

**Q: What areas do you service?** We're the exclusive Fibre Tech™ dealer for North & Central Texas, covering Dallas-Fort Worth to Austin. Houston has a different dealer. Call to confirm coverage in your area.

**Q: What warranty comes with pool resurfacing?** Traditional resurfacing typically includes 1-3 year warranties. We include an exclusive 25-year manufacturer warranty, the longest in the industry.

## **Gunite Pool Resurfacing: Special Considerations**

### **Why Gunite Pools Need Special Attention**

Gunite pools represent the majority of North Texas pools and face unique resurfacing challenges:

**Common Gunite Problems:**

* Structural cracks from ground movement  
* Extreme surface roughness  
* Calcium buildup in pores  
* Rebar corrosion and rust stains  
* Hollow spots (delamination)

### **Traditional Gunite Resurfacing Limitations**

**Replastering Gunite:**

* Only addresses surface, not structural issues  
* New plaster bonds poorly to old gunite  
* Cracks reappear within 2-3 years  
* Roughness returns quickly

**Why It Keeps Failing:**

* Gunite continues deteriorating underneath  
* Moisture penetrates through cracks  
* Temperature changes cause separation  
* Each resurface adheres worse than the previous one

### **Fibre Tech™ for Gunite Pool Resurfacing**

**Permanent Gunite Solutions:**

1. **Crack Injection:** Seal all cracks permanently before fiberglass application  
2. **Structural Stabilization:** Flexible fiberglass prevents future cracking  
3. **Waterproof Barrier:** Stops water penetration completely  
4. **Smooth Forever:** Eliminates gunite's natural roughness

**Results:**

* No more replastering every 7 years  
* 70% reduction in chemical usage  
* Comfortable smooth surface  
* 25-year warranty protection
