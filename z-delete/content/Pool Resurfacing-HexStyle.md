## **Understanding Pool Resurfacing in Texas**

### **The $43,900 Problem Texas Homeowners Face**

Pool resurfacing is the process of applying new surface material to a deteriorating pool interior. In North Texas, harsh weather and clay soil movement mean pools require resurfacing every 7-10 years using traditional methods like plaster, marcite, or pebble finishes.

Traditional resurfacing materials—plaster, marcite, pebble, quartz—provide temporary solutions that fail predictably. Each replastering investment of $8,000-$15,000 deteriorates within the decade, creating an endless cycle that costs Texas homeowners $43,900 over 20 years.

### **Why Traditional Resurfacing Continuously Fails in Texas**

Four critical factors guarantee traditional resurfacing failure across our state:

* **Material Porosity:** Plaster and concrete surfaces contain 14-18% porosity, allowing water penetration that accelerates chemical degradation and structural deterioration.  
* **Thermal Incompatibility:** Rigid surfaces cannot accommodate Texas' extreme temperature swings, creating expansion stress that manifests as spider cracks within 24 months.  
* **Chemical Vulnerability:** Extended swim seasons (March-November in South Texas) require constant chlorination that attacks cementitious materials, reducing surface integrity by 15% annually.  
* **Soil Movement:** Texas' diverse soil conditions—from Blackland Prairie clay to coastal sand—create unique structural stresses that traditional surfaces cannot withstand.

### **The Hexagon Solution: Permanent Pool Transformation**

Hexagon Fiberglass Pools eliminates the resurfacing cycle through our exclusive pool conversion process—permanently transforming your existing pool into a non-porous fiberglass surface using patented HexConvert™ technology.

**One investment. One warranty. Forever resolved.**

## **Gunite Pool Resurfacing: Hexagon's Specialized Solutions**

### **The Gunite Challenge Across Texas**

Gunite pools dominate the Texas market (73% of existing pools), yet face accelerated deterioration from regional conditions:

**Structural Vulnerabilities:**

* Soil movement creates varying pressure (clay to limestone)  
* Temperature cycling causes 0.3% dimensional change  
* Calcium leaching weakens matrix by 2% annually  
* Rebar corrosion expands, creating delamination

**Surface Failures:**

* Plaster bond failure occurs within 5-7 years  
* Surface porosity reaches 18% over time  
* Roughness index increases 300% by year 5  
* Chemical demand escalates 45% versus new

### **Why Gunite Replastering Repeatedly Fails**

**Deteriorating Substrate:** Each replastering adheres to increasingly compromised gunite. Previous plaster layers create weak bonding planes. Moisture infiltration continues beneath new surfaces. Result: Shorter lifespan with each application.

**The Hexagon Gunite Solution**

Hexagon Fiberglass Pools' gunite conversion process addresses root causes:

**Hexagon Structural Stabilization:**

* Epoxy injection seals all cracks permanently  
* Flexible fiberglass accommodates movement  
* Waterproof barrier prevents infiltration  
* 25-year structural integrity guarantee from Hexagon

**Hexagon Surface Transformation:**

* Permanent smooth texture (0.5 micron finish)  
* 70% chemical reduction versus plaster  
* Zero porosity eliminates staining  
* Comfort restoration for bare feet

**Hexagon's Documented Results:**

* Gunite conversions completed statewide  
* 98% customer satisfaction rating
