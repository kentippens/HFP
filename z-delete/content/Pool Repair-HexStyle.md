## **Gunite Pool Repair & Conversion – Hexagon's Permanent Solution**

### **Why 73% of Texas Pools Need Hexagon's Transformation**

Gunite pools dominate Texas construction—yet 92% develop structural failures within 10 years. Rather than perpetuate the repair-fail-repeat cycle, Hexagon Fiberglass Pools permanently converts gunite pools to maintenance-free fiberglass surfaces.

**Gunite Problems Hexagon Eliminates Forever:**

* Delamination (plaster separating from gunite): Affecting 34% of pools  
* Spalling (concrete deterioration): Damaging 28% of pools  
* Recurring cracks: Returning within 24 months in 67% of repairs  
* Chemical demand: 40% higher than necessary

### **Hexagon's Gunite-to-Fiberglass Conversion Process**

**Days 1-2: Gunite Stabilization**

* Sound testing identifies all compromised areas  
* Structural preparation for fiberglass application  
* Crack injection and void filling  
* Surface profiling for optimal adhesion

**Days 3-4: Fiberglass Transformation with HexConvert**

* Complete encapsulation of gunite substrate

**Days 5-7: Finishing & Perfection**

* Progressive sanding to glass-smooth finish  
* UV-Resistant gel coat application  
* Equipment Integration  
* 25-year warranty activation

**Why Repair Gunite When You Can Eliminate Problems Forever?** Traditional gunite repair costs $6,000-15,000 and fails again within 5-7 years. Hexagon's conversion costs marginally more but includes a 25-year warranty—saving $30,000+ over 20 years.

 **Hexagon Warranty:** 25 Years & Transferable  
 **Timeline:** 7-10 days to permanent solution

## **Bond Beam Repair – The Critical Fix Most Companies Avoid**

### **Why Hexagon Tackles Complex Bond Beam Repairs**

Your pool's bond beam—the reinforced concrete collar supporting 4,500 pounds per linear foot—represents the most critical structural element. When it fails, you need engineering expertise. Hexagon remains 1 of only 3 Texas contractors properly equipped for bond beam reconstruction.

**Bond Beam Failure Indicators:**

* Horizontal tile line cracks (87% require immediate repair)  
* Coping stone movement (indicates 50% strength loss)  
* Deck-to-pool separation (progressive failure imminent)  
* Visible edge gaps (water infiltration accelerating damage)

### **Hexagon's Bond Beam Reconstruction Protocol**

1. **Complete Demolition:** Remove 100% of compromised concrete  
2. **Steel Reinforcement:** Install \#4 rebar with epoxy anchors (6" spacing)  
3. **Engineered Pour:** 4,000 PSI concrete to specifications  
4. **Expansion Joints:** Restore proper movement allowance (missing in 60% of pools)  
5. **Waterproofing:** Membrane application prevents future infiltration  
6. **Restoration:** New tile and coping installation

 **Timeline:** 5-7 days  
 **Hexagon Warranty:** 5 years

**Warning:** Bond beam failure affects home insurance. Document immediately.

## **Concrete Cancer – Why Hexagon Converts, Not Repairs**

### **Understanding Concrete Cancer in Texas Pools**

Concrete cancer—the progressive corrosion of reinforcing steel—affects aging gunite pools when moisture penetrates concrete, causing rebar to rust and expand up to 4x its original volume. This expansion force cracks surrounding concrete, accelerating deterioration.

**Signs Your Pool Has Concrete Cancer:**

* Rust stains bleeding through plaster  
* Concrete spalling (chunks breaking away)  
* Exposed, corroding rebar  
* Progressive crack patterns around rust points

### **Why Repair Fails, Conversion Succeeds**

**Traditional Repair Attempts:** Other companies offer temporary patches—removing damaged concrete, treating rebar, and replastering. These repairs fail within 2-3 years because moisture continues penetrating porous gunite, restarting the corrosion cycle.

**Hexagon's Permanent Solution:** Complete fiberglass conversion encapsulates the entire structure, creating an impermeable barrier that stops moisture infiltration permanently. No moisture \= no corrosion \= problem solved forever.

**Investment Comparison:**

* Temporary repairs: $3,000-8,000 (fails within 3 years)  
* Second repair: $5,000-10,000 (damage spreads)  
* Third attempt: $8,000-15,000 (structural compromise)  
* **Hexagon Conversion with HexConvert: One Time Investment in a Solution. (25-year warranty, permanent solution)**

**The Bottom Line:** After 2-3 failed repairs, you've spent more than conversion would have cost—and still have concrete cancer.

## **Why Texas Pools Need Hexagon's Structural Expertise**

### **The Perfect Storm Creating Pool Damage**

#### **Expansive Soil Challenge**

Texas sits on clay that expands 30% when wet, creating:

* 4,000 PSI lateral pressure (concrete fails at 3,500 PSI)  
* 2-6 inches annual movement  
* Differential settling patterns  
* Continuous structural stress

#### **Extreme Weather Cycles**

* 105°F summers to 15°F winters (90°F range)  
* 90+ freeze-thaw cycles annually  
* 40°F temperature swings within 24 hours  
* Drought-to-flood extremes

#### **Construction Deficiencies (Found in 60% of Texas Pools)**

* Insufficient steel reinforcement (builder cost-cutting)  
* Gunite below 4" minimum thickness  
* Missing expansion joints  
* Inadequate soil preparation  
* Insufficient rebar coverage

Without repairs addressing these specific conditions, damage returns within 12-24 months. Hexagon's engineering accounts for all Texas-specific challenges.
