## **What Is Pool Conversion? Pool Resurfacing vs Pool Replacement**

### **Pool Conversion Process Explained**

Pool conversion is the process of transforming your existing concrete, gunite, marcite, plaster, or vinyl liner pool into a smooth, durable fiberglass surface without the need for excavation or starting over. This pool renovation method is also known as pool resurfacing with fiberglass, and it's revolutionizing how Texas pool owners approach pool remodeling.

Unlike complete pool replacement, which requires tearing out your entire pool and rebuilding from scratch, our pool conversion process works with your existing pool structure. We create a custom fiberglass shell by hand to fit your current pool's exact shape and dimensions.

### **Who Needs Pool Conversion Services?**

Pool conversion is perfect for Texas homeowners whose pools are experiencing:

* **Surface Problems:** Staining, algae buildup, rough textures that hurt bare feet  
* **Maintenance Nightmares:** Constant chemical balancing, weekly cleaning, acid washing  
* **Structural Issues:** Minor cracks, chips, or surface deterioration  
* **High Costs:** Spending $150+ monthly on chemicals and maintenance  
* **Aesthetic Concerns:** Outdated appearance, faded colors, permanent stains

**The bottom line:** If your pool works but doesn't bring you joy anymore, pool conversion might be your answer.

### **Pool Conversion Contractors in Texas: Types of Pool Conversions We Specialize In**

#### **Convert Concrete Pool to Fiberglass**

Concrete and gunite pool conversion is our specialty. Concrete and gunite pools are notorious for their porous surfaces that harbor algae and bacteria. The rough texture is harsh on skin and swimwear, while the alkaline concrete constantly throws off your water chemistry.

**Our gunite pool conversion solution:** We transform your concrete pool into a smooth, non-porous fiberglass surface that's gentle on skin and resistant to algae growth.

**\[üîß Convert Your Concrete Pool \- Get Started Today\]**

#### 

#### **Convert Marcite Pool to Fiberglass**

Marcite and plaster pool resurfacing with fiberglass is increasingly popular in Texas. Marcite and plaster surfaces deteriorate over time, becoming rough and stained. They require frequent acid washing and traditional resurfacing, making them expensive to maintain.

**Our marcite pool conversion solution:** Replace your failing marcite with a durable fiberglass surface that maintains its smooth finish and vibrant color for decades.

**\[‚ú® Transform Your Marcite Pool \- Free Assessment\]**

#### 

#### **Convert Vinyl Liner Pool to Fiberglass**

Vinyl liner pool conversion eliminates the need for recurring liner replacements. Vinyl liners need replacement every 7-10 years, and they're susceptible to tears, fading, and wrinkles. The recurring replacement costs add up quickly.

**Our vinyl liner conversion solution:** Eliminate liner replacements forever with a permanent fiberglass surface that flexes with ground movement and resists damage.

**Better Footing:** The textured fiberglass finish provides secure footing without being rough or painful.

**Algae Resistance:** The non-porous surface doesn't provide places for algae and bacteria to hide, creating a healthier swimming environment.

**Chemical Reduction:** Less chemicals mean fewer skin and eye irritations, especially important for family pools.
